					Exit is my 2nd Semester project from my course of studies in Animation & Game (A&G). It was the
					first
					proper project that I have ever made with the Unity Engine.
					With a team of 4 fellow A&G students total and a external sound producer we created this game in the
					time span of about 4 months while simulating a industry-like environment with reviews from "product
					owners" (our professors).
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					It was a very important project for me as I learned asset management working with Perforce and other
					people at the same time.
					Especially communication and naming conventions were areas that created some problems, but in the
					end,
					we had a game that was presentable.
